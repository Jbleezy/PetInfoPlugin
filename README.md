# Pet Info
Saw a cool pet? Have no idea what it was or how to get it?
Now you can find out without having to even ask other players!

The Pet Info plugin for RuneLite allows you to highlight pets,
have their names displayed above their heads and even right-click for more info!

##### Known issues:
* An overlay was draw for a non-existent pet, hopefully it's fixed,
but I can't recreate the issue.

##### Possible Issues:
* It is possible that I have the wrong IDs for the Smokedevel and Snakeling pets.
Therefor it is possible that some variants of the pets might not be recognised,
or that some actual mobs might be mistaken as a pet.

##### Plans for the future:
* I would like to add information of pet variants,
but don't have the pets to be able to check what NPC IDs are representative of what variants.
Any help on this front would be greatly appreciated!
* I would also like to add and Owner option,
but the only potential implementation I have now is far from elegant.
