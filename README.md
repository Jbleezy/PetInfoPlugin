# Pet Info
Saw a cool pet? Have no idea what it was or how to get it?
Now you can find out without having to even ask other players!

The Pet Info plugin for RuneLite allows you to highlight pets,
have their names displayed above their heads and even right-click for more info!

##### Known issues:
* Sometimes the plugin will think there is a pet where there is non. 

##### Possible Issues:
* It is possible that I have the wrong IDs for the Smokedevel, Snakeling, and other pets.
Therefor it is possible that some variants of the pets might not be recognised,
or that some actual mobs might be mistaken as a pet.

##### Plans
* I want to re-write the description text to be more consistent, as well as more understandable.
* At the moment pets will be detected when right clicking in a widget (i.e. the bank or inventory), that needs to be fixed

###### Special thanks to the devs of the Implings and Menu Entry Swapper plugins
